#There are five trees in Jack's front yard. He checks each tree to find out how tall it is in inches and writes the height on a sheet of paper. Jack's list: 98, 94, 41, 96, and 11. What is the average height of a tree in Jack's front yard?

tree_1 = 98
tree_2 = 94
tree_3 = 41
tree_4 = 95
tree_5 = 11

#finding totl.
sum = tree_1+tree_2+tree_3+tree_4+tree_5
print ("The sum of all trees is: ", sum)

#finding avrg.
average = sum/5
print ("the average measurment of a tree is: ", average)
